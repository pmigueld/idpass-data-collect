# ID PASS DataCollect Mobile App

Mobile application for data collection in the field, built with Vue.js and Capacitor.

## Prerequisites

1. Node.js 22.x or higher
2. Android SDK (for Android builds)
3. Xcode (for iOS builds, macOS only)
4. pnpm 10.x

## Local Setup

This package is part of the ID PASS DataCollect monorepo. Install dependencies from the workspace root:

```bash
# From workspace root
pnpm install
```

The mobile app uses `@idpass/data-collect-core` from the workspace, so no separate installation is needed.

### Environment Configuration

Create `.env.local` in the mobile package directory:

```sh
VITE_BACKEND_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
VITE_DB_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD=your-encryption-password
VITE_FEATURE_DATACOLLECT=true
VITE_DEBUG=true
VITE_SYNC_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Development

Launch a development version of the app (web-based):

```bash
# From workspace root
pnpm dev:mobile

# Or from this directory
pnpm dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:8081`.

## Android Build

### Debug APK

```bash
pnpm build:android:apk
```

### Release APK

1. Go to the `android` directory and create `keys` folder
2. Add your keystore file (e.g., `selfreg-keystore.jks`)
3. Create `keys.properties` file with the following variables:

```properties
KEY_PATH=../keys/selfreg-keystore.jks
KEY_PASSWORD=your-key-password
KEY_ALIAS=your-key-alias
KEY_STORE_PASSWORD=your-keystore-password
```

4. Build the release APK:

```bash
pnpm build:android:apk:release
```

## iOS Build

```bash
pnpm build:ios
```

This will build the app and open Xcode for further configuration and deployment.

## Accessing Configuration Forms

1. Log in to the admin dashboard at your backend URL
2. Navigate to Apps and select your application configuration
3. Download the configuration JSON or scan the QR code
4. In the mobile app, go to **Entities** and click **Create group**
