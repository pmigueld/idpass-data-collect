# ID PASS DataCollect Admin UI

Web-based admin interface for managing ID PASS DataCollect application configurations, users, and monitoring data synchronization.

## Purpose

The Admin UI provides a comprehensive interface for:
- Managing application configurations (apps)
- Configuring entity forms using Form.io builder
- Setting up external sync adapters (OpenSPP, OpenFn)
- Configuring field mappings for OpenSPP synchronization
- Managing user accounts and permissions
- Monitoring entity counts and sync status

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.x or higher
- pnpm 10.x
- Backend server running (see `packages/backend`)

## Setup

This package is part of the ID PASS DataCollect monorepo. Install dependencies from the workspace root:

```bash
# From workspace root
pnpm install
```

## Development

Start the development server:

```bash
# From workspace root
pnpm dev:admin

# Or from this directory
pnpm dev
```

The admin UI will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the next available port).

## Building for Production

```bash
# From workspace root
pnpm build:admin

# Or from this directory
pnpm build
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory.

## Technology Stack

- Vue 3 with Composition API
- Vuetify 3 for UI components
- Form.io for form building
- Pinia for state management
- Vue Router for navigation
- Axios for API communication
- TypeScript for type safety

## Environment Variables
